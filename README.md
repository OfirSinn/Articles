# This is my Blog site.
this site is as the title says, for articles.
and it uses [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) as its base, with a few modifications.

## The mods:
- RTL for the entire site
- an Hamburger menu for navigation on mobile,
	the Hamburger menu is ripped from [owly-lab](https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/owlly-lab) 

## Bug tracker
RTL compatibility issues:
	*non known yet*

Hamburger menu:
- [ ] sliding is not smooth

General
- [ ] sub folders do not work, the pathing is bugged out.

## plan for future.

this is just a starting point and unfortunately the lack of built in Hamburger menu for mobile made it quite a pain and very very buggy to install. 
There is a very Good chance I'll switch to Hugo or another SSG which knows how to deal with RTL and has a proper mobile experience, since in the end although im most familiar with obsidian flavored markdown I can see myself using something else.
